# Model analysis project

The project is about power market pricing and how a hydroelectric plant in another country can maximize it's revenue from exporting to Germany under constraints.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [ModelProject.ipynb](ModelProject.ipynb).

The Germany.csv file contains price data which was used to calibrate the model.
